## 1. Create a Firebase Project
Add project in the Firebase console. Ignore if you already created

## 2. Set up your environment and the Firebase CLI
### 2.1 Install Node.js environment
You'll need a Node.js environment to write functions. Refer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
### 2.2 Install Firebase CLI
You'll need the Firebase CLI to deploy functions to the Cloud Functions runtime. Refer: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#setup_update_cli

## 3. Initialize your project
### 3.1 Login to your Firebase
Run this command to log in via the browser and authenticate the Firebase CLI.
```
firebase login
```
### 3.2 Go to your Firebase project directory
Run this command to pull the source code and go to your Firebase project directory
```
git clone https://github.com/inspireui/firebase-notification-realtime-chat
cd firebase-notification-realtime-chat
```
### 3.3 Initialize project
Run these commands
```
firebase use <project-id>
firebase init functions
```

You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/son/Desktop/firebase-notification-realtime-chat

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory


=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project flutter-practice-001 (Flutter Paractice test)

=== Functions Setup
